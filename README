This is an old quick and dirty port of Flickr::StatsD https://github.com/iamcal/Flickr-StatsD
(or at least the parts I needed!)

Saw this sitting around on and old server and figured I'd throw it out there.

There's a simple python server (and test client).

The PHP folder has an example of how I called it (Timer.php) and also how I generate
graphs by calling rrdtool (yes, quite lazy, I know).

I use the Daemon class by Sander Marechel http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/
It depends on PyRRD http://code.google.com/p/pyrrd/ 
I was also using corestats.py (LGPL) http://www.goldb.org/corestats.html

Which is the same concept but talking to Graphite as the storage backend
