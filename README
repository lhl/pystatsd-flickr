This is an old quick and dirty port of Flickr::StatsD https://github.com/iamcal/Flickr-StatsD
(or at least the parts I needed!)

Saw this sitting around on and old server and figured I'd throw it out there.

It depends on PyRRD http://code.google.com/p/pyrrd/ 

I was also using corestats.py (LGPL) http://www.goldb.org/corestats.html
